102 BELLUM cAmimnAn.

mentem et . . . exsecrata est; after exsecrari the adversative conjunction
is omitted; asyndeton. —gaudium, joy, as an inward feeling3
laetitiam includes its outward manifestatum, and is, therefore,
stronger than qaudium.

2. praedae . . . fore, would briny them booty rather titan loss. —-
quippe qui: in Sallust takes the indicative, in Cicero and Caesar
the subjunctive. -in usu et cultu: on victus et cultus, see on
XXXVII. 6. As the poor live from hand to mouth, they have
nothing to lose except their food and clothes ι usus means food.

3. Post eum diem: i.e. Dec. 43 Caesar would have said postri-
die eius diei.—quidam 1.. Tarquinius: as a rule quidam follows
the proper name.

4. praeterea: sc. docet. —Lentulus et . . . deprehensi, the
’ arrest qs Lentulus, etc. In English and the modern languages gen-
erally, the verbal noun (abstract construction) is often used where
the Latin uses the passive participle (concrete construction).—
eoque: -que is adversative, and means but. ——quo: i.e. nt eo.

5. conclamant: the subject is alii, pars, plerique, taken together;
in other words, the senators. The reasons, it will be remarked,
are given by means of different constructions‚ by a participial clause
(rati, eta), by quia, and by an adjective clause (plerique . . . obnoxii),
according to Sallust's characteristic way 01 varying his construc-
tion. In English, parallel constructions must be used.—in tali
tempore, in such a crisis ; this phrase in the historians always
refers to the critical point 01 an event. ——tanta vis hominis, a man
qf such influence ,· of. scriptorum mayna ingenia in VIII. 3, and. tanta
vis morbi in XXXVI. 5 ; such expressions remind us 01 the Homerie
ἱερὸν μένος Ἀλκινόοιο, βίη Ἡρακληῒη. Here it emphasizes Crassus
as the possessor 01 millions‚ in antithesis to Crassus the man. —
plerique . . . obnoxii: Crassus, according to the testimony 01
1113 contemporaries, used his money both legitimately and illegiti-
mately‚ to increase his political power.--ui:l . . . referatur: 30.
α consule ad senatum ‚- referre is the technical term 101· laying a
question before the senate.

6. consulente Cicerone, when Cicero put the question. In the
senate the consul's duty was referre and consulere (to ask the opin-
ion and take the vote 01 the senate), rather than to advocate his
own views. —potestatem ε 30. indicandi.
