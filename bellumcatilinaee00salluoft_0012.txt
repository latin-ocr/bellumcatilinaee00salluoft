had literary aspirations. They certainly bore no fruit at that
time.

Sallust from the first espoused the popular cause, of which
Caesar was already the chief. champiou. It was probably during
Caesar’s first consulship in 59 B.c., that Sallust was elected to
the quaestorship, the first step in political preferrnent at Rome.
Since Sulla's time the office brought with it a seat in the Senate.
Some years later we meet him again, as tribune of the Commons.
The times were storiny3 bloody street-fights between the hired
bands of P. Clodius, the chief democratic ruffian, and the hench-
men of T. Annius Milo, the champion of the senate, were the
order of the day. Law-abiding citizens feared a catastrophe

Appius Claudius Pulcher struck Sallust’s name, along with
many others, off the official list of the Senate‚ on the ground
that he led a scandalous life. Unluckily there is too much
reason to think that the charge was not baseless; and yet it is&
hard to believe that the censor’s action was not dictated chiefly
by politics. Like many other prominent men in the popular
party, Sallust took refuge in Caesar’s camp. When, in the year
following, Caesar entered Rome as its master, Sallust received
