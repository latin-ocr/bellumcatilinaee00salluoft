lus et ceteri (synesis). In similar cases Cicero regularly uses the
singular, the historians the plural.—ex agro Faesulano: the
manuscripts have in ayrum Faesulanum‚· but this cannot be right, as
Catiline, according to XXXVI. 1-3, had already arrived at Faesu-
lae, where Manlius' camp was. At all events, he must have arrived
