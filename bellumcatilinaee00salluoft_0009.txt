PREFACE.

Tms edition of Sallust's Bellum Catilinae is based on the
third edition of the work by Director J. H. Schmalz.

Director Schmalz’s extensive scholarship, his profound knowl-

altered, so as to conform to American usage. As in the United
States Sallust is most frequently read by students who are not so
far advanced in their Latin studies as those for whom Schmalz’s
book was prepared, additional notes on grammar, style, and
translation have been added wherever it seemed useful. For
the same reason a departure has been made from Schmalz’s
practice in another particular. While he confines his historical
comments to the narrowest limits, it has been thought best
here to make them as complete and helpful as possible. Τ110
