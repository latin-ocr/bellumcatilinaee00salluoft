82 BELLUM CATILmAE.

3. Ciceronis: objective genitive. Cicero was charged with put
ting Roman citizens to death without trial; namely, the five cor¹
spirators spoken of in LV. -posteaz this odium was already
manifested on the last day of Cicero's consulship when the tribune
Q. Metellus Nepos forbade him to address the people‚ because he

had put Roman citizens to death without trial.
4. ea res: in none of Cicero’s writings that have come down to

us, do we find any allusion to this tale. —pro magnitudine, consid—
eriny its importance.

XXIII. 1. haud obscuro: litotes—loco, with natus means
stock, ancestry ,· otherwise condition, station, — copertus: Aulus
Gellius tells us that Sallust wrote so instead of coopertus.—
probri gratia: the character of Curius' misconduct is unknown.
Though many men of that period, including Sallust himself, were
so punished by the censors‚ Curius is the only one of whom Sallust
reports this fact 3 qratia here introduces the cause, not the purpose.

2. non minor . . . audacia, was no less fickle than alaram.—
reticere and the following infinitives depend on quicquam pensi
habebat—suamet ipse: see note on XX. 6.—prorsus, as in XX.
12, introduces the last of a series.

3. Fulvia is otherwise unknown. —inopia ε ablative of cause.—
maria mont-isque: a proverbial expression which the Italian lan-
guage has preserved to this day, premettere mari e monti.—agitare
is often used by Sallust instead of ayere; with an adverb it means
to bellave in a certain way.

4. insolentiae, the unusual behavior : as appears from the expres-
sion quam solitus erat. *haud occultum habuit, did not keep con—
cealed .· from this use of habeo developed its use as an auxiliary.—
sublato auctore, without yiviny her authority.—quoquo modo:
Fulvia got information from Curius repeatedly and in various
ways.

5. Ea res: i.e. the fact that Catiline's plans became known.
The optimates were not ambitious to face the dangers the nevz
consuls must be exposed to.

6. pleraque: singular ; see note on XVII. 6. —invidia: the
nobility disliked Cicero partly because he was an upstart, partly
because he had prosecuted Verres and supported the Manilian law.
Among his opponente were Hortensius, Crassus, Caesar. -aestua·
