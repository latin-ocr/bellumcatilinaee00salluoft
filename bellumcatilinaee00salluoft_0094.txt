2. sat-1⁸, very.- often found in Sallust, Caesar, and Oicero's Ἑρμεῖ-ε. i

3. scapton-um . . a ingenia: we say writers qs yreat ability. ‘—
pro maxumis: i.e. quasi maxuma essent.

4. qui iecore, who performed yreat deeds; as the sentence is gen· λ
eral, qui fecere is not said of the Athenians on].y; ficere is used ⁴
absolutely.

5. ea copia, i.e. copia eorum; namely, clarorum z'nyeniorum: an
abundance of able writers. Livy calls Fabius Pictor, who lived during
the second Punic war, the most ancient of Roman historians, though
Fabius himself speaks of others who preceded him—negotiosus: ’

’ being heightened by parallelism of expression. —seque remque
publicam: Sallust like Tacitus uses -que . . . -que only when the
first member is a personal pronoun. Jug. C. 5 is an exception to
this usage.

4. in bello . . . in. pace: correspond to in bello . . . ubi pazt
evenerat of §3.-qui . . . pugnaverant: alludes to the story of
young Manlius, who was put to death by his father, T. Manlius

Sallust says in ch. 52, though Livy says (vm. 7) against the
