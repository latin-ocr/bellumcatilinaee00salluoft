This Series contains the Latin authors usually read in American
schools and colleges, and also others well adapted to class-room
use, but not heretofore published in suitable editions. The several
volumes' are prepared by special editors, who aim to revise the
text carefully and to edit it in the most serviceable manner.
Where there are German editions of unusual merit, representing
years of special study under the most favorable circumstances,
these are used, with the consent of the foreign editor, as a basis
for the American edition. In this way it is possible to bring out
text-books of the highest excellence in a comparatively short period
of timu.

The editions are of two kinds, conforming to the different
methods of studying Latin in our best institutions. Some conta1’n
in the introductions and commentary such a careful and minute
treatment of the author's life, language, and style as to afford the
means for a thorough appreciation of the author and his place in
Latin literature. Others aim merely to assist the student to a good
reading knowledge of the author, and have only the text and brief
explanatory notes at the bottom of each page. The latter are
particularly acceptable for sight reading, and for rapid reading
after the minute study of an author or period in one of the fuller
editions. For instance, after a class has read a play or two of
Plautus and Terence carefully‚ with special reference to the pecu-
liarities of style, language, metres, the methods of presenting a
play, and the like, these editions will be admirably suited for the
rapid reading of other plays.

The Series also contains various supplementary works prepared

- by competent scholars. Every effort is made to give the books a

neat and attractive appearance.
