iv PREFACE.

notes, besides Schmalz, 1 have had recourse to the editions of
Jacobs-wia, Dietsch, and Kritz; also to Inaugural Disserta-
tions by P. Schultze and F. Uber, to a Proyramm by Dr.
Prammer‚ and to Wolffiin’s Archiv.

In conclusion Ι take pleasure in thanking Director Sohmalz
for his courteous permission to make his Sallust the basis of the
present edition of the Bellum Catilinae. To Prof. E. M. Pease,
the editor-in-chief of this series, I am deeply obliged for many
and important suggestions; also to Prof. J. K. Lord. Both
of these gentlemen, moreover‚ had the kindness to read the proof
with the greatest care and conscientiousness. Lastly, Ι return
thanks to Dr. J. C. Morgenthau and Mr. J. F. Mulqueen, of the
College of the city of New York, for repeated and courteous
aid given me in the progress of the work.
