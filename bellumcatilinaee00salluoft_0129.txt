noras. 103

7. machinatum: used in the passive sense. Sallust often uses
deponent verbs so. -appellato Crasso, {f Crassus were named, i.e.
as a conspirator. Instead of joining the participle appellati to illius
(sc. Crassi) (participium coniunctum), Sallust uses the ablativo
absolute. The ablative absolute is often used so, when the parti-
ciple should qualify a possessive genitive or a personal pronoun.
By its use the subordinate clause is emphasized.

9. ipsum Crassum: it is unlikely that Crassus, who had every-
thing to lose by Catiline's anarchical undertaking, was connected
with the conspiracy. Cicero's stem refusal to implicate Caesar
makes Crassus' suspicions improbable.

XLIX. 1. C. 'Calpurnius Piso: consul in 67, proconsul of
Gallia Narbonensis in 66 and 65, was in 63 accused of extortion
(repetundarum) by the Allobroges. —neque predo neque grana,
neither by money nor by personal influence; the two most effective
means of controlling the action of a dishonest politician. Sallust is
fond of combining the two words. — C. Caesar: when in 62 Caesar
was accused of complicity in Catiline's schemes, Cicero testified in
his favor.

2. uterque . . . exercebant: a synesis that occurs only here, in
Asinius Pollio (Ep. 33, 3) and B. Alexandrinum, 60, 5. — oppugna-
tus: sc. a Caesare, who was patron of the Galli T ranspadam'.—repe-
tundarum: the explanatory words, propter . . . supplicium iniustum,
show that repetundarum has considerably changed its original mean-
ing. Originally iudicium repetundarum meant a suit to recover
money ; here it means ⁶ maladministration.' —ex petitione pon-
micatus: the electiou took place in March, 63. - ab adulescen-
tulo Caesare ε Caesar, who was born in 100 B.c.‚ was then in his
thirty-seventh year, and Catulus was some twenty years older.
Perhaps Catulus himself had styled Caesar adulescentulus.

3. Res: the scheme to accuse Caesar of being Catiline’s accom-
plice. —oportunaz credible. —privatim . . . publice: do not
modify debebat, but must be taken with the verbs suggested by the
words liberalitate and muneribus ,⁰ the construction is not regular.
—muneribus: refers to the games given by him as aedile.—
grandem pecuniam: before holding any office, Caesar's debts‚
it is said, amounted to 1300 talents (about 31‚500‚000).

4. quae se . . . audisse dicerent: quae, ut diceba-nt, audissent.
