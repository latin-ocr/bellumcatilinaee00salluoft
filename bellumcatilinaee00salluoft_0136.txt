110 BELLUM CATILINAE.

39. Graeciae morem imitati: according to the Roman histo
rians, the Laws of the Twelve Tables were based on Greek laws;
but long before this decemviral legislation, the Romans used both
the verbera and the supplicium, as Caesar must have known.

40. res publica adolevit: nations, like individuals, grow and.
age. —tum : begins the consequent clause. — quibus legibus: the
repetition of the antecedent in the relative clause is frequent in
Caesar and in official documents. Sallust may have repeated
leyibus to imitate Caesar's style. The antecedent of quibus leuibus
is aliae leyes only, as appears from ς 22.

41. hanc ego causam, this objection‚ as appears from the use
of quominus. —in primis magnam: a superlative3 the weiyhtiest.

42. illis . . . in nobis: another change of construction for
variety's sake. Sallust was the first to use the dative of the posses-
sor, not only with things but also with qualities. — ea bene parta :
ea is the same thing as imperium ,· its use emphasizes the various
things that make up the imperium. When the Roman spoke of the
imperium Romanum, including himself in the term, he said haec,
which refers to the first person; but here the Romans of Caesar's
day are not conceived as a part of the empire‚ but in antithesis
to it ; hence the use of ea, the ordinary pronoun of the third
person.

43. Placet, Do I therefore move? placet, or placuit, often begins
resolutioris of the senate. —censeoz is another word used to begin
resolutions of the senate ; like decerno, censeo in the singular means
I propose, I think. —pecunias, their property, its original meaning.
-—— quae . . . valent, which are best provided with means to keep them
safe. —referat . . . agat: the technical terms for bringing a ques-
tion before the senate or people respectively. -— contra rem publi-
cam: see on L. 3.

LII. 1. verbo . . . adsentiebantur: besides expressing his
opinion in a set speech (sententiam dicere), and going to one or the
other side on a division of the house (pedibus ire in sententiam ali-
cuius), a senator might simply state that he favored the motion
made by a previous speaker (verbo adsentiri alicui). — alii: only two
motions had been made, one by Silanus, the other by Caesar3 still
alii is right here, because alius precedes—varie: strengthens the
expression alius alii, and impresses the reader more vigorously with
