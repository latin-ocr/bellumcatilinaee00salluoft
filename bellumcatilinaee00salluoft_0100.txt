74 BELLUM CATILINAE.

creditur appears harsh; Cicero would probably have used the acc. ’
c. inf. ’

4. dis hominibusque infestus, hatz'nq both qods and men. In
Sallust infiseus is always active in meaning. Phrases like the pres-
ent are common in Latin and Greek; cf. Cicero, Phil. II. 26, where
he uses dis hominibusque hostis to express the climax of human
wickedness. —quietibuffi sleep, as the antithesis to viyillis proves.
The plural of quies, otherwise rare, is used partly to strengthen the
antithesis by its parallelism to viyiliis, partly to indicate its repeti-
tion every night. — vastabat: compare the eirpression vastus ani-
mus, attributed to Catiline in V. 5.

5. colos: archaic for color. Sallust also uses labos, honos, odos,
and lepos. He uses them chiefly in the speeches to give these an
archaic coloring. —citus . . . tardus: the typical Roman affected
a dignified, even gait, as well as a seriouS, even stern expression of
countenance. The Emperor Claudius was criticised for his jerky
walk—prorsus: in fine, often introduces the last in a series of
words or clauses. — facie voltuque: features and expression.

XVI. 2. inis: refers to iuventutem; synesis. -— falsos: belongs
both to testis and signatorem signator means the witness to a will. —
commodare: is a colloquial word 3 it is in the historical infinitive‚
whilst habere, as well as maiora alia, is the object of imperabat, which
Sallust construes with the infinitive like moneo, hortor, &c.; cf. X. 4.

3. insontis sicuti sontis, those who had not offended him as well
, as those who had. —gratuitm without hope of qain5 frustra, on the
contrary, means without the hopedfor quin. The above stories
must be received with some soepticism.

4. aes . . . erat: owing to the general extravagance, many
Romans throughout the empire sank deeply into debt, a circum-
stance that favored Catiline's designs.

5. In Italia, διας supply erat—in extremis terris: Pompey
was just then conducting the war against Mithradates, king of
Pontus. This led him from Asia Minor to the eastermost countries
at that time known to the Romans—petenti: Catiline's second
candidature for the consulship (64 nc.) is referred to. He had
been a candidate in 66 13.o.; cf. ch. XVIII.- senatus . . . inten-
tus: as Catiline was of noble family, he was watched less closely
by the senate. - sed ea: of what genderis ea 7 why ’ἒ See on L 2.
