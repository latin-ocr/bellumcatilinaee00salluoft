gigantic proportione, some of its ruins still measuring seventy feet in

4. gloria: Cicero says of Aemilius Paullus (Off. ΙΙ. 76), omni
Macedonum yaza potitus nihil domum suam intulit praeter memoriam

5. hi, the Romans qs to-day, in antithesis to maiores nostri.—
socii: in Sallust and Cicero, are the inhabitants of the conquered
provinces in opposition to cives. -id demum: merely repeats
iniuriam facerem a colloquial way of putting the thought strongly.

XIII.³ 1. Nam, here is not a causal conjunction, introducing
the proof of what precedes, but emphasizes what follows as espe-
cially worthy of note—memorem: is in the subjunctive because
