mirers of Sallust. Quintilian, for instance, finds fault with his
introductions both to the Catiline and the Jugurtha: they have
no real connection with the works to which they are prefixed.
The criticism is well founded, though these prefaces are well
worth reading as modes of vigorous thought vigorously ex-
pressed. It is chiefly >Sallust's style, however, to which the
ancients took exception. It is abrupt, they tell us; its brevity
verges on obscurity3 Sallust borrows too many obsolete words
from the elder Cato and other ancient historians. [f we study
Sallust's style, we shall soon find that it differs widely from
Cicero’s and Caesar’s. Sallust makes no attempt >to write with
the rhythmic flow, which is so marked a characteristic in ‚Cicero
and writers of his school. As Sallust cut loose from the old
annalists and founded a new school in history, so as a stylist
he struck out in a new direction. His sentences are crisp and
pointed, not flowing and melodicus. Modern criticism finds
both styles allowable, and holds that both may be handled
with great effect. That Sallust is a vigorous and impressive
writer needs no demonstration, though his epigrammatic brevity
is at times hurtful to the clearness of his sentences. But it
must not be inferred that Sallust is a careless stylist. He not
only abounds in antithesis, but he arranges the words con-
trasted with conscious effort to produce the greatest effect;
hence the frequent occurrence of chiasmus in his writings. He
is even more fond of parallel arrangement in his sentences
(anaphora). Series of words he ari-anges in pairs, omitting
conjunctions, wherever it is feasible. How painfufly he strives

to vary his expression, is apparent to the least observant reader, f

and his art here often degenerates into artificiality. To secure
variety in his constructions, he perversely puts aside established
rules in the use of correlatives‚ as when he replaces alii . . . alii
by alii . . . pars‚· to attain the same end he avoids parallelism
in construction where others would seek it3 as for instance in
Bellum Catilinae, IX. 3, he says: audacia in bello, ubi pax evenerat
aequitate . . . rem publicam curabant, where it would have been
so much more natural to write : audacia in bello, in pace aequitate,
