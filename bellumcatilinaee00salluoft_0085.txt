NOTES.

-0—

1. 1. Omnis: ace. plur. In Sallust and his contemporaries all ἱ
stems, i.e. all substantives and adjectives of the 3d declension
with the gen. plur. in -ium, have the acc. plur. in -1's. —hominesz
is the subject of niti, Whjlst the clause omm's homines summa ope niti
is the subiect of decet—sese: Sallust uses the acc. c. inf. after
studeo, even when the subject is the same as that of studeo,-—an
archaic and colloquial construction seldom found in Cicero. — silen-
tio: i.e. without doing anything worthy of ⁷ being spoken of:
ablative of accompaniment. —vitam transeant: implies a life
of idleness; vitam aqere, an active life. For the mood see A. 8⁶ G.
331, e, 13 B. 295, 53 G. 546; Η. 498, Π.

2. nostra: expressed, because emphatic, being in antithesis to
pecora—vis, activity.-animi imperio . . . utimur, the mind
we use chiefly ιο rule us, the body ιο serve us. -altemm ε refers to
animus. SaHust often uses neuter pronouns to refer to masculine
or feminine substantives denoting things.

3. ingeni: Sallust, like all pre-Augustan writers, formed the
gen. sing. os substantives ending in -ius and -c'um in -ί, not in -ii. -
virium, bodily soree ,· note how the meaning of this word is changed
as compared with vis in Ι. 2. —opibus‚ resources. —nostn'2 A.
ἀ G. 194, b; B. 242, 25 G. 3623 Η. 446, N. 3. —quam maxime:

- A. ao. 93, b; B. 240, 3; G. 317; H. 170, 2, (2).-effi0ere= like

facere, is often used with two accusatives; e.g. fortuna eos efficit
caecos (Cic. Lael. XV . 54).

4. forma, beauty.—v-irt:us . . . habetur, intellectual and moral
excellence is a ylorz'ous and lastiny possession. As generally in Sal-
lust, habeo is here used in its primitive meaning, ιο have, ιο possess,

5. morta-lis: is freely used by Sallust instead of homi nes.
Cicero uses mortales only when accompanied by omnes, cuncti, or
multi—vine . . . an: instead of -ne . . . an Sallust sometimes
used an alone in double questions.
