it might readily stand for the verdict of modern scholarship.
Cicero, it is true, is relegated to the background as far as
possible; and yet he is optumus consul; he is the man—upstart
though he was—to whom, iu Rome’s crisis, her aristocrats
turned to save the commonwealth31 he is the orator whose
brilliant speech was so useful to the republic.2 From party
spirit, Sallust is not as free as he claims to be. His J ugurthine
war is one long indictment of the senatorial party. It is hard
to understand how in the Bellum Catilinae he could tax the
nobility with withholding the honors of a triumph from the
nobles Q. Marcius Rex and Q. Metellus Creticus‚³ when it
was well known that Pompey and his partisans were the real
obstacles. But perhaps Sallust forgot that Pompey was not at

in Spain 4 is also inspired by partisanship. So much is certain,
that the Pompeians, and especially Pompey’s freedman Lenaeus,
bore Sallust a bitter grudge, aud assailed him without measure
both as a man, a historian, and a writer. However, admitting
that Sallust is not without blemish·as a historian, his merits, it
must be conceded, far outweigh his faults, and the picture he
has drawn of Rome In the days of Catiline, if perhaps unfair
to one or another of his characters, in the main gives us a correct
impression of the last days of the Roman republic.

Sallust’s merits as a writer were acknowledged without stint
by Roman writers and critics under the Empire. Quintilian,
generally a man of sober judgment, does not hesitate to match
him against Thucydides. The great historiali Tacitus calls him
rerum Romanarum florentissimus auctor. He paid him a still
greater compliment by taking him as his model for style. And
yet the ancient critics were by no means indiscriminate ad-
