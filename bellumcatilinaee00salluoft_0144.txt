118 BELLUM cAmLmAn.

3. qua 1111 descensus erat: i.e. qua illi descendendum erat‚· an
archaic turn of phrase, like mihi cautio est, for mihi cavendum est.
It is a good illustration of a phrase meaning originally possession
coming to signisy obligation or necessity. Compare the English
‘ 1 have to write.’ The place indicated is the northern slope of the
Apennines between Bologna and Modena.

4. Neque tamen Antonius, ete: and though Catiline was
hastening to escape from Metellus, yet on the other hand Antonius,
etc. Sallust omits the protasis which is easily supplied. —utpote
qui . . . sequeretur: this sentence sums up all of Antonius'
advantages and all of Catiline's difficulties. Antonius, like Catssine,
was south of the Apennines. As Metellus had closed the passes
that led northward across the Apennines, Catiline was now forced
either to seek escape by way of Lucca, Forum Clodii, and Luna,
or to fight Antonius.—- tardatos in tuga: belong together and are
in antithesis to expeditus.

5. praesidi, reinforcements; see 011 LVI. 4. —in tali re, under
such circumstances5 like in in tali tempore in XLVIII. 5.—conss1-
gere: the battle took place early in 62 13.c.

LVIII. 1. neque . . . neque, and that on the one hand a cowardly
army does not become brave, nor οη the other hand, etc. —ex ignavo

. . ex timido: chiastic arrangement.

2. natura aut moribus: see on LIII. 6. —horterez present
potential‚ ideal 2d pers. sing. —timor animi: we do not translate
animi, which Sallust is fond of adding to words like timore, virtus
(II. 3; LIII. 1), ferocia (LXI. 4), cupido (LI. 4).

3. quo . . . monerem . . . uti . . . aper-item: observo the
change of conjunction ; advocavi is a historical perfect.

4. socordia atque ignavia: are subject nominatives to attulerit,
according to the correct Latin construction3 to have written scitis
socordiam atque iynaviam . . . quantam . . . attulerit would have been
a Greek construction. —quoque modo: i.e. ec quo modo. —prae-
sidia opperior: see LVII. 5 and note.

5. iuxta mecum: colloquial for aeque ac eqo.

6. unus: the army of Antonius —alterz the army of Metellus
Celer. — si : i.e. etiam si. — animus teratz we should desire ic. —
placet, with a subject infinitivo, occurs first in Sallust.
