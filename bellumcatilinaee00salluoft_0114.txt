88 BELLUM CATILINAE.

lascivia,· see on Ῑ. 2.—-0mnis: Cicero always says invadere in
aliquem; see on XII. 2.

2. cuiquam: belongs to loco as well as to homini ; quisquam, when
used as an adjective, regularly qualifies only substantives denoting
persons. The expression is colloquial, and the separation of cuiquam
from Ioco makes it less harsh.

3. magnitudine: ablative of cause to be taken with insolitus. —
adflictare sese: Cicero (Tusc. III. 82) tells us that women ex-
pressed their grief by tearing the cheeks and breast and beating
the head. ——rogitare omnia, omnia pavere: by this‘ chiasmus
omnia is emphasized; royitare is colloquial for royare.—de110fls:·‘l
means everything that contributes to the enjoyment of life.

4. lege Plautia: enacted by the tribune Plautius or (vulgar) ’
Plotius in 78 nc. ; it provided severe penalties against disturbers
of the public peace. The charge was based on the rising in Etruria.
—interrogatus est: cf. XVIII. 2.—1‚. Paulo: L. Aemilius
Paulus was the brother of the triumvir Lepidus. As consul in

Laeca’s house, and the day after the attempt to assassinate

Cicero at his own house was made.— expurgandi: Cicero every-
where says sui puryandi causan but Sallust, in accordance with the
usage of the popular language, often , uses the compound, where
Cicero and Caesar use the primitive. — senatum: the meeting
took place in the temple of Jupiter Stator on the Palatine hill.

6. quam . . . edidit: the first oration against Catiline is meant,
Cicero published it in 60 13.c. along with the other speeches delivered
by him as consul. Hence it was unnecessary for Sallust to report
it here.

7. ut erat paratus, beinq prepared.— ortum: qualifies se, the
subject of instituisse ‚· it is therefore unnecessary to supply anything:
see on V. 1. —mquiunus civis: Cicero was a native of Arpinum,
a Volscan town, which had, however, been granted the full Roman
citizenship since 188 13.c. Sallust, imitating Cato, often uses nouns
as qualifiers of other nouus, as inquilinus is used with civis here.

8. hostem atque patricidam: they called him hostis (originally
stranqer), because he had forfeited his rights as a citizen, and,
