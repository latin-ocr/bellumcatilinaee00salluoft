death and dismay. Rome itself was the scene of riots and
bloodshed. Ambitious young ruffians, like P. Clodius, at the
head of armed mobs, took possession of its streets. Honors
andfflower were the reward of bribery and lawless violence.

Roman politics, he had already made serious studies in Greek
and Latin literature. A passage in the Bellum Catilinae² sug-
gests that even before entering upon his politieal career, Sallust
