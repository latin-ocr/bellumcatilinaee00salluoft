78 BELLUM CATILINAE.

the words Gnaei Pompei veteres fidosque clientis happen to make a Δ

dactylic hexameter. —praeterea, either before or afler. L. Cal-
purnius Piso Frugi, however, had been murdered there by a wild
Spanish tribe at the time of the Cimbric War (101 13.c.).

6. Nos . . . relinquemus: statements like this impress the
reader with Sallust's caution as a historian ; compare the end of
XXII.

XX. 1. paulo ante, a little while ayo. He refers to XVII.
—1n rem fore, to be advantayeous. —- universos: is in antithesis
to oum sinyulis. —huiusce modi : these words show that Sallust
reports only the substance of Catiline's speech.

2. ni: colloquial for nisi. See on VII. 7.—spectata: neuter,
though both subjects are feminine; the regula'r usage jn„ Sallust.
—mihiz A, ἃ, G. 232, ας Β. 189, 2; G. 352 ; H. 388, 1. This dative
is not found in Caesen—nequiquam 3 . . cecidisset, affairs
would in vain have taken α favorable turn. —oportuna2 is a pred-
icate adjective when it is used with cado, accido, evenio, &c.—in
manibus: qualifies dominatio as its epithet ; the supremacy which
is in your hands, would have been, &Q The use of a preposition
with its object as an attribute is uncommon in Cicero and Caesar;
cum and sine are most frequently used so. -frustra fuissent:
esse with a predicate adverb is mostly colloquial. —per ignaviam:
i.e. per homines iynavos: the abstract for the concrete3 iynaviam
points back to virtus in the antecedent clause, as vana inqenia
points back to fides ‚· vana inqeniazhomines vani inqenz‘i. —incerta
pro certis: found also XVII. 6.

3. quia . . . eo: the eo simply repeats the clause with quia5
but Sallust is fond of oonversational turns, and in conversation
repetitions of this kind are common. — tempestatibus: as Cicero
uses the plural of tempus in the sense of crisis, so Sallust uses the
plural of tempestas. -animusz I ; see on ΙΙΙ. 4. —fortis fidosque: ’
an alliterative combination found in all periods of Roman literature.

4. ea demum: see on XII, 5. Why is ea feminine ?

5. divorsi: separately.

6. Ceterum, as for the rest. This is the original meaning of
the word. Cicero and Caesar do not use it as an adversative con-
junction.—animus: to be translated as in ἓ 3. —nosmet ipsi:
observe the strong emphasis.
