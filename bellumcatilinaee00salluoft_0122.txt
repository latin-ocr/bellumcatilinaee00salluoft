6. cuiusque modi genus hominum, men qf every station in lise 3
a singular pleonasm for cuiusque yenerz's homines.

XL. 1. P. Umbrenus: was a freedman. According to Cicero
he was aided in his attempt to gain over the Allobroges for Cati-
line's undertaking, by P. Furius, a colonist from Faesulae, and
by Q. Annius Chilo. —Allobrogumz a Gallio tribe dwelling be-

tween the Rhone and the Isere. They were conquered by Q. Fabius „
- Maximus in 121 1³.c., but not formally incorporated into the Roman

I'rovince until Caesar’s time. They had sent ambassadors to Rome
to compl-ain of the oppressions of the Roman officials and mer-
chants. —publice . . . oppressos: both the Allobrogian govern-
ment and the private citizens were overburdened with debt. The
reasons for Lentulus’ belief, it will be remarked, are expressed‚ 10 by
a participia] clause (publice . . . oppressos) 3 20 by a quod clause:
another, but by no means commendable instance of Sallust’s
craving after variety. ,

2. negotiatus erat: Cicero, in his speech for Fonteius, informs
us that Gaul was full of Roman merchants, who controlled all its
business. — tantis malis: dative ; supply futurum esse.

3. miseriis: dative 3 the construction is the same as in tantis
malis. — at ego: at at the beginning of the speaker's remarks, like
ἀλλὰ in Greek, indicates that the speaker combats the views just ex-
pressed. - rationem . . . effugiatis: ostendam here has two objects,
rationem and the indirect question qua ista mala effuyiatis. In Cicero
and Caesar the noun object is always inserted in the indirect ques-
tion: ostendam qua ratione ista mala effuyiatis. The subjunctive may
also be explained as a subjunctive in a characteristic relative clause.
4. ea res: expresses affirmatively what is denied by the preceding
nihil. “

5. D. Bruti: see on XXV. 1.- aliena consili: the only place in
Sallust where aliena is construed with the genitive. But non aliena,
it should be observed‚ is used by litotes fer particeps, which would
govern the genitive. D. Brutus himself was not connected with the
conspiracy.—nam: assigns the reason why it was saie for Umbre-
nus to take the Gauls there, an idea easily supplied by the reader—
ab Roma: popular speech, which prefers clearness to grammatical
correctness, regularly employed prepositions with names of towns.
