64 BELLUM CATILINAE.

Catiline's grandfather distinguished himself in the second Punic
War, in which he lost an arm. He was praetor urbanus in 197 Β.ο.
Catiline himself was born about 108 sc. His house stood on the
Palatine Hill, the fashionable quarter of Roma—ingemo malo
pravoque: his natural disposition was bad and perverse (pravus=
crooked).

2. bella intestina: the civil war between Sulla and Marius and
the revolt of Lepidus took place when Catiline was a young man.
— caedes, rapinae : opportunities therefor were plentiful during
Sulla's domination. Catiline murdered his brother, his sister's
husband (Q. Caecilius), and M. Marius Gratidianus, a relative of
Marius and according to Cicero and Sallust his own grown-up
son—ibique: for in iis rebus, meaning bellis, caedibus, &a—
iuventutem exercuit, he trained himself whilst a younq man ; for
iuvenis se exercuit. Sallust often turns adjective or adverbial quali-
fiers into abstract nouns.

3. Observe that in the following sketch of Catiline's character,
the copula and the conjunctions are omitted: to insert them would
have weakened the word-picture—Corpus . . . Animus: in aee
cordance with the proposition, laid down in Ι. 2, nostra omnis vis in
animo et corpore sita est, Sallust ‘treats Catffine's character from
these two points of view—vigiliae: instead of viyiliarum in the
plural is used to secure parallelism with inediae, algoris.-— supra
quarn: a rare construction found again in Bell. Jug. XXIV. 53 it
occurs at least once in Cicera—cuiquam: is used here because
the thought is negative ; his power to bear hunyer, &c., qu almost
incredible.

4. varius: εποικίλος, πολύτροπος, versatile ,- it is often coupled
with multiplez, as in Cicero‘s portrait of Catiline, pro Caeli0‚ VI. 14:
hac ille tam varia multiplicique natura. —cuius rei lubet : the tmesis
tf cuiuslubet is less harsh, because we distinctly feel that lubet is a
vern—simulator et dissimulator: verbal substantives in -tor

and —sor are sometimes used as adjectives with the names of per· .

sons, rarely of things, and then express a lasting quality: simulo,
to pretend to be what one is not; dissimulo, to pretend not to be
what one is.—-su1‚ his own, his property,· the gen. of suum. This
is perhaps the only passage 'where profusus is construed with a geni—
tive. The construction is explained by the influence of. the parallel
