tive specie is used with the genitive, like causa.

3. post illa tempora: aiter the restoration of the tribuneship,
70 iac—nominibus: is explained by the clauses beginning by
alti and pars. Observe that, for variety's sake, Sallust writes alii
. . . pars instead of the regular alii . . . alii ,· alii, pars and quisque
are in distributive apposition to quicunque.-bonum publicum,
tlte ρεπεν-αἶ qood ; see note on malum publicum in XXXVII. 8.

XXXIX. 1. ad bellum man'tumum: by the Gabinian law
(67 Β.ο.), Pompey was entrusted with the conduct of the war
against the pirates, which he finished in eighty days. In 66 nc.
the war against Mithradates was confided to him by the Manilian
Law, and he had not yet returned when Catiline's conspiracy was
discovered. —imminutaez supply sunt. — paucorum: here, as
above, pauci means the optimates or aristocrats.

2. innoxii, unharmed. The word is found in the passive sense
only in Sallust and the poets. — ceteros, qui . . . tractarent:
the nobles who did not approve the extreme measures of their
party, were prosecuted.

3. dubiis rebus: ablative absolute. —novandi spes, the hope ⁰f
effectz'nq a revolution. Sallust is the first writer to use novare in this
sense. When used without object novare always means to effect a
political chanye. —eorum: i.e. plebis (cf. ς 2): synesis.

4. aut, or at least ,· the so-called aut diminutivum—neque, but
πω,- a common meaning. ——inis2 i.e. the Catilinarians. —qui
forent i.e. si jor-ent. Sallust now puts aside the second alternative
stated above. ——defessis et exsanguibus: qualify illis (the Cati-
linarians). — qui plus posset :⁷ a. covert manner of designating
Pompey, who had just conquered the East, and was at the head of
a powerful and victorious army that would surely have crushed
Catiline, even is the latter had at first gained some successes.

5. Fuere men: here Sallust resumes the thread of his story,
interrupted at XXXVI. 3. ——retractum . . . iussit: according
to Roman law, a father had the right of life and death over his
children. Translate as if the text read: quem parens ex itinere
retraxitet necari iussit.
