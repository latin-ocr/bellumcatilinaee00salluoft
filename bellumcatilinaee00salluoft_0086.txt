60 BELLUM GArrnmAn.

6. priusquam: with a verb is often best translated by before and
a participle in -z'ny, as here, before beyinniny. —incipias‚ consulu-
eris : the second person sing. is used indefinitely. A. ἃ, G. 309, α ;
B. 356, 3; G. 267; Η. 518, 2.—consulto‚ facto: A. ει G. 292, b;
B. 218, 2, c; G. 390; H. 414, N. 3. Sallust always uses this con-
struction when what is necessary is expressed by a verb. In English
the verb depending on opus est is put in the infinitiva. -- consulto ε
refers to animi in the preceding sentence; tacto, to corporis.- the
position is therefore inverted or chiastic. A. ἀ G. 344, s; B. 350,
11. ος G. 6843 H. 562.

7. utrumque: i.e. vis corporis and virtus animi5 for the neuter
gender, see note on alterum, Ι. 2.—per se indigene, incompleta
in itself. — alterum: is in distributive apposition to utrumque,-
“ each ⁰f the two,'' 8210. ⁴

ΙΙ. 1. Igitur: contrary to the usage of Cicero and Caesar, Sal-
lust always places iyz‘tur first in the declarative sentence. —namz
introduces the reason why Sallust has used the word reyes. Trans-
late: I say kinys, sor, &th—imperi, yovernment: in Homer and
the Greek historians, as well as in Roman history, the earliest
rulers are called kings. Sallust makes'the statement general. —-
divorsi, in various ways. — pars . . . alii: used as correlatives
instead of aliz· . . . alii, are in distributive apposition with reyes.
When Sallust says pars . . . exercebant, he probably thought of
the kings in the Homeric' poema—etiam tum: Homer's kings
do not fight for conquests, but for honor and fame. — vita agita-
batur: colloquial Latin for vita aqebatur. Sallust often uses the
colloquial frequentatives instead of their primitivos. —placebantz
alicui placet often means somebody is satisfted with.

2. Cyrus, king of Persia (13.0. 559), was the first great eon·
queror, whose exploits are set forth at length in the Greek his-
tonans—Lacedaemonii et Athenienses: the Spartans began
their conquests about nc. 724, when they conquered the Messe-
nians; Athens began its conquests after the Persian Wars (B.c.
490-479).—urbis‚ independent eines, like those of ereece ; na-⁴
tiones, when opposed to urbs or populus, means uncivilz'zed tribes,-
urbis subigere, refers to the Lacedaemoniam and Athenians3
nationes subigere, to Cyrus: the arrangement is therefore chias-
tic.—-habere, made, not consz'dered.—putare: with in and the
abl. generally means to see, to find. —plurumum posse, accom-
