nomns. 89

moreover (atque), parricida, because he attempted to destroy his
country, the common mother of all Romans.

9. 'l'um ille, &c.: the remark here quoted was not made at this
session of the Senate, but at a meeting held before the election‚ in
reply to Cato's threat to prosecute him. —incendium: the Latins
were fond of 'using metaphorically words meaning ⁶ to burn.’ Here
incendium means Catiline's ruin. He will put it out, not with water,
but by tearing down everything about him 3 ‘the con flaqration intended
to destroy me I shall put out by, ἃς.

XXXII. 1. ex curia: as stated above, the Senate met not in the
ouria Hostilia, but in the Temple of Jupiter Stator. Here curia
means meeting of the Senam—volvens: vole-o in the sense of to
consider caresedIy, is a favorite word with Sallust—insidiae con-
suli : is felt by Sallust as equivalent to insidiae quas parabat consuli ;
hence the dative consuli.—nocte: the night from the 8th to the
91:11 of November.

2. mandat, quibus. . . possent. opes . . . confirment: here,
as often, Sallust mixes up two constructions‚ construing mandat
both according to its form, as a primary, and according to its mean-
ing as a secondary tense.

2. neque contra patriam . . . neque quo. Suc. : a good instance
of Sallust’s fondness for varying constructions. —neque quo . . .
faceremus, nor by their means to, διο. ; the coniunctiori quo here
retains its old force as an ablative. —corpora nostra qui: in
Latin the relative often refers to a person denoted by the posses-
sive. —faeneratorum: at this time the usual rate of interest was
twelve per cent, but often a much higher rate of interest was
exacted ; e. g. M. Brutus, Caesar's slayer, demanded forty-eight per
cent from the Salaminians. There were laws against usury, but
they were not always enforced. Τὴθ laws against debtors were
still very severe; the creditor might proceed not only against the
debtor's property, but also against his person. —patriae . . .
lama: both words depend on expertes ; again Sallust varies the con-
struction. Expers with the ablative is archaic and poetic. The
men spoken of had probably left Rome to avoid the consequences
of their banhaptoy, and seem to have lost some of their rights as
citizens. -more . . . uti: what is referred to by these words is
