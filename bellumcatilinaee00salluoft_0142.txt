116 BELLUM oAmmAn.

—neglegere . . . denegare: historical infinitives. Το make them
depend on induxerat would be to make Caesar a calculating schemer‚
which Sallust evidently does not mean to d0.—bellum novom:
seems to imply a sneer at Pompey‚ who had got the credit for con-
quering the Sertorians in Spain, Spartacus in Italy, and Mithradates
in Asia, though the hard work had been done by Metellus Pius,
Crassus, and Lucullus. Caesar⁷s Gallic, British, and German wars
were, strictly speaking, neW. -—- enitescere: a rare word, apparently
new in Sallust's time.

5. severitas: Cicero in his letters repeatedly complains that
Cato, by his stem, uncompromising honesty‚ imperilled the interests
of the commonwealth and of his party—factione cum factiosis,
in party spirit with partisans. — sequebatur: compare Cicero, Tusc.
Quaest. 1: 109: yloria virtutem tanquam umbra sequitur, a sentiment
repeated by Seneca (Ep. 79, 13): yloria umbra virtutis est ‚⁸ etiam
invitam sequitur.

LV. 1. in Catonis sententiam discessit ι a parliamentary
technical term equivalent to pedibus in sententiam alicuius ire, found.
= in ch. L. 4. The term for voting against a motion was in alia omnia
discedere, for the consul put the motion by say1ng, qui Ιιοο οεηεεὶίε,
illuc transite, qui alia omnia (sc. censetis), in hanc partem—novare-
tur: used impersonally ; see on XXXIX. 3. —tresviriz the singu-
lar is triumvir, the plural either tresviri 01· triumviri. The tresviri
capitales had charge of executione and priscus, whilst they also
performed the functione of a modern police magistrate.

2. in carcerem: the Mamertine prison, which lay at the foot of
the Capitoline Hill, east of the Temple of concord. According to
tradition it was built by Ancus Martius, whilst the innermost part,
which was underground‚ was called Tullianum; this was said to
have been built by Servius Tullius, and to have been named after
him. It seems to have been originally a well (called in old Latin
tullius), and to owe its name to this circumstance. — ceteris:
dative or ablative ς see on LII. 25.

3. ad laevam: supply partem-humi depressus, sunk into the
yround.

4. incultu, throuyh neylect. Sallust is the earliest writer in whose
works this word is found.

5. demissus est: through the opening in the ceiling of the Tul- ι
