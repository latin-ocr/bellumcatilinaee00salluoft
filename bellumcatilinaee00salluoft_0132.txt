106 BELLUM CATILINAE.

trations of the principle here laid down may be found. —Contra
lubidinem animi sui, contrary to their own inclinations. —recte

atque ordine : as was riyht and proper ‚· a common combination.
5. Bello Macedonico: the third Macedonian War, 171—168 13.c.

—Persez Sallust has the ablative Perse and the accusative Persen
of the name of King Perseus. These forms suppose a nominative
Perses of the first declension. —opibus creverat, owed its yrowth
to the aid,· opibus is an ablative of cause. The Romans had been
aided by the Rhodians in their war against Antiochus, king of
Syria, and after the' victory of Magnesia (189 nc.) ceded Lycia
and Caria to the Rhodians. —infida . . . fuit: they took no active
part in the war with Perseus, but were suspected by Rome. —
impunitos . . . dimisere: the proposal to make war on the
Rhodians was defeated by the elder Cat03 still Lycia and Caria
were taken away from them. —divitiarum: the Rhodians had
grown very wealthy by their commerce.

6. bellis Punicis omnibus: the first Punic War lasted from
264 to 241 B.c.; the second or Hannibalic War‚ from 218 to 201
B.c. ; the third (149 to 146) resulted in the destruction of Carthage.
—nunquam . . . fecere: the facts of history do not bear out this
statement. —per occasionem, when occasion offered.

7. scelus, your inde'ynation at the crimea—dignitas, your seff-
respect.

8. digna pro factis, commensurate with their crimes‚· diynus fol-
lowed by pro and the ablative is rare. -novom consilium: Caesar
calls the proposal to inflict capital punishment on the conspirators
a new measure, because both some older laws and a Lex Sempronia
of C. Gracchus made it illegal to punish a citizen with death, except
by order of the people.-—0mnium ingenia, any punishment man’s
inqenuity can devz'se; the cause is used for the effect 3 metonymy.

9. composite atque magnifice, with all the yraces of composition
and rhetoric. To compliment them for using the casum rei publicae,
to air their rhetorical skill, savors of bitter irony. rapi and the
infinitives that follow are the items of the enumeratio, and therefore
in apposition with quae victis acciderent. —matres familiarum: for
familiarum, see on XLIII. 2. —collubuissetz used personally; so
very rara—cruore atque luctu: observe that Sallust couples
the abstract noun luctu with a number of concrete substantives;
a combination to be avoided.
