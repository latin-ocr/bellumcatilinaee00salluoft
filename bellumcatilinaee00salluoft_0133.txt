nomn-s. 107 ’

10. quo ma orauo pertinuit, what was the purpose of their dis-
course? illa oratio for illorum oratio, as ez· eo numero for ex eorum
numero ; see on XLII. 3. — scilicet : as usual, introduces an
ironical remark—res and oratio are in antithesis as deeds and
words.

11. iniuriae suae: i.e. iniuriae sibi illatae ‚· the possessive pronoun
takes the place of an objective genitive. A. & G. 217, a 3 B. 243, 2 ;
G. 363 R. ; H. 396, ΙΙΙ. 2.—gravius habuere: the usual expres-
sion is qravius tulere ‚· but Sallust is fond of the verb habeo.

12. alia aliis licentia est, what is allowed ιο some is ηοι allowed
ιο others ,· lieentia, taken concretely, is quod licet. —vitam habent:
i.e‚ vivunc; with it connect iu obscuro. —quid2 accusative of the
inner object or cognate accusative. —fortuna‚ their position in lffe·
Observe that the clauses qui demissi . . . sciunt and qui maqno . . .
novere run parallel, except that the clause si quid . . . deliquere in
the first clause is balanced by eorum sacta in the second.

14. in imperio: i.e. in iis qui imperio praediti sunt, as appears
from the antithesis.

15. equidem ego, I, sor my part. Sallust uses equidem in
speeches only. Cicero never uses eqo in connexion with equidem.
—minores quam . . . esse, are sliqht in compar-ison wilh their,
Sic. —poatrema : only the last results.

16. eos mores: eos and eam are predicate accusatives. —eos

. . cognovi, such Ι know to be, 8⁵0. —viriz a complimentary
expression3 ιῘιαι honorable qencleman.

18. metus aut iniuria: sc. reorum; the sear os the criminals or
the qreatness os their crime. —subegssn for eoeqil ; cf. X. 5.

20. De poena: while the sentence de timore, etc., pointedly dis-
cusses the metus of ἓ 18, the present sentence touches the iniuria of
ἓ 18 only by implication. —equidem2 emphasizes the subject
pronoun, though this is not expressed. —id quod res habet, what
is thesact: asser-ts the objective correctness of the assertion, which
the word equidem had emphasized as his personal opinion. Caesar
here avows his belief in the Epicurean doctrine that the soul is not
immortal. —aemmnm the deepest human mz'sery; the word
aerumna was falling into disuse in Sallust's time. — ultra, on the other

side qs the yrave5 ultra is an adverb here—neque curae . . .
esse: this is an inference from Caesar's Epicurean opinion; mors
ultima linea rerum est, as Horace, another Epicurean, expresses it.
