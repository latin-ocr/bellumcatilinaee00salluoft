viii INTRODUGTION.

history of Catiline’s conspiracy was the first result of his literary
activity. It was probably written in 43 B.c. and published in
42. Sallust next wrote his history of the Jugurthine war: this,
as well the history of Catiline’s war, has corne down to us. His
third, and perhaps most important, work did not meet with
the same good fortune. It dealt with the history of the Roman
Republic from 78 B.c. to 66 13.c., and would have shed much
needed light on an interesting part of Roman history. F our.
speeches and two letters are all that remains of the work.
Sallust was not destined to enjoy his literary leisure for along
time. In 36 B.c. - some say as early as 39 13.c.— he died, leaving
his palace and his famous gardens to his sister’s grandson, who
had adopted his name. Sallust’s mansion subsequently became
one of the favorite residences of the Roman emperors.

11. SALLus'r As A Husronnm.

To Sallust belongs the honor of being Rome's first historian
in the true sense of the term. Before him the Roman writers of
history followed the annalistic method. They were chroniclers
rather than historians. Sallust, instead of following in their
footsteps, went to Greece for his model, and chose Thucydides.
Like the Greek writer, Sallust not merely recorded facts, but
strove to give a picture of a period, to trace the connection of
events, and to study their causes and effects. Like Thucydides,
too, he chose for his subJ'ects periods either contemporary or
near to his own times. Furthermore, he largely modelled his
style upon that os the Athenian historiari, and even borrowed
reflections and special passages. He was an apt and successful
scholar, as is shown by the fact that he,in turn,became the
model of Tacitus, the greatest of Roman historians; and yet
he fell below the excellence of the Greek writer. From Thucy-
dides, also, he borrowed the practice of introducing speeches
supposed to have been delivered by the actors in his historical
dramas; for none of his inserted speeches are genuine. we
shall more easily understand the liberty thus taken, if we recall
