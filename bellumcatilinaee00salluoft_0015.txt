that even so good a scholar as Cicero regarded history as a

’ branch of rhetoric, and that the ancient historiatis looked upon

the form of their works as at least equal in importance to their
historical correctness. Their histories were, above all, works of
literary art. That Sallust, however, duly felt the historian’s
duty to present the facts correctly, we may infer from the choice
of his subjects. With the incidents of Catiline’s conspiracy
he must have been familiar, ι for he was* an eyewitness. His
Historias· included th‘e years of his boyhood and youth, whilst
his residence in Numidia as its governor must have given him
unusual opportunities for becoming acquainted with the story
of Jugurtha's war. That he consulted earlier writers when
necessary, we know from his quoting Sisenna, and from the
charges made against him by his enemies, that he borrowed
obsolete words from the elder Cato. He also sought verba]
information from the actors and witnesses of the events he
portrays; for instance, in ch. 48. 9 of the Bellum Catilinae he
repeats statements made to him by the triumvir Crassus. It
does not seem too bold to assume that he learned many im-
portant facts from his wife Terentia, who at the time of Cati·
line's plot was married to Cicero. Still, Sallust cannot be called
a careful historian‚ in the modern sense of the expression.
Students will infer this from his errors in the chronological
order of the incidents recounted in the Bellum Catilinae, to
which attention is called in the notes.

WVas Sallust a truthful and impartial historian? It would be
difficult to convict him of deliberate falsehood. Indeed, when
we bear in mind that he was a contemporary os many of the
events he narrates, and that he was the friend or enemy of some
of the principal actors in his story, we must accord him no little
praise for his fairness. Some critics tell us that the aim of the
Bellum Catilinae, for instance, was to clear Caesar’s reputation.
If they are right, they must nevertheless concede that Sallust
is far from being an indiscriminate advocate of Caesar. His
pen-pertrait of the great statesman and general, a masterpiece
like all his character-painting‚ is not a fulsome eulogy3 indeed,
