noras. 63

taken with aetas. —0orrupta tenebatur: Le. corrupta est et corrupta
manebat.

5. cupido: a poetic word, instead of the classical cupiditas.
Sallust was the first to use it in prose. — eadem: qualifies sama et
invidia and is in the ablative. Censure and envy pursued Sallust
aswell as other public men of his day, though, apart from ambition,
he was free from their wickedness. Compare this seli-portrait of
Sallust with his life.

IV. 1. animus, I.-ubi . . . requievit: after his return from
the govemorship of Numidia, in 13.c. 45. —miseriis atque pen·-
culia: in ΠΙ. 3, he calls them multa advorsa. —bonum otium, my
precinas leisure.— colundo, διας may be either datives or ablatives ;
see on intentus, II. 9. —- servilibus officiis: the old Romans looked
upon farming as a most honorable occupation. Perhaps Sallust.

- means to say that a man of education should not devote himself to

farming exclusively, which may be as well carried on by the igno-
rant slave.

2. a quo incepto, &ez we know nothing further of these early
litera-ry attempts of our author. —ambitio mala: mala, because it
brought such evil consequences upon him—eodem: for ad idem
inceptum, as often in Sallust the substantive antecedent is replaced
by an adverb—carptim, piecemeal. Sallust proposes to tre-at
selected parts of Roman history, such as Catiline's conspiracy, the
war with Jugurtha, the period from Sulla's death to the rise of
Pompey (his lost work). — spe, metu, partibus: an active politi-
oian might be led by the hope of gain, the sear of loss, or party
⁴ spirit to distort historical truth.

3. paucis: sc. verbis; some, however, take it for an adJ‘ective
used as a substantive. The expression was colloquia13 compare
paucis te volo, l wish to say a few words to you, which is often met
with in the comio writers—facinus: without an adjective always
has a bad meaning in Sallust. — novitate: what has never hap-

pened before is novum ‚· Rome had never seen a crime like Cati·
line's and had never been in so critical a position.

V. 1. 11. Catilina: he was of the qens Seryia, a patrician qens
that had lost its wealth. The oldest Sergius mentioned in Roman
history was one of the decemvirs deprived of power in 449 ac.
