the fact that the vote was far from one-sided ; indeed, the result
became so doubtful, that Cicero thought fit to make another speech
(the fourth against Catiline). Then Nero made his motion to
adJ‘ourn, which even Silanus supported, saying that by summum
supplicium he meant imprisonment. Then Cato spoke, and his
speech decided the issue. -Μ, Porcius Cato: afterwards called
Uticensis, because he committed suicide at Utica, was at this time
thirty-two years old and tribune elect. Much of the speech that
follows is unsuited to so young a man.

2. The opening of this speech is an imitation of the exordium of
Demosthenes' Third Olynthiac. —Longe alia, very different ; lonqe
regularly goes with alius, lonye or multo with alitem—res atque
pericula nostra, our danyerous position; hendiadys.

3. patriae, parentibus, arla, atque focis: these four words
comprise all that is most sacred to men 3 aris et focis is a proverbial
combination. — monet cavere: the use of the infinitive after
moneo, like its use after hortor, is rare in Caesar and Cicero ; see on

4. cetera: by prolepsis is contrasted with the following hoc.—
persequare: observe the indefinite 2d p. sing. —h00: is the
subject of accidat as well as of evenit. — nihil fit reliqui: the pas-

5. cuiuscumque . . . sunt: expresses Cato's contempt3 they
are not worth giving an opinion about. —amplexamini: you clinq
to vehemencly.

7. in hoc ordine: here in the senata—ea causa: causa, with a
demonstrative pronoun, takes the preposition, except in archaic
writers and Sallust.

8. qui . . . iecissem: a causal clause3 hence the subjunctive.
—animm delicti, gratiam iecissem: correspond respectively to
lubidini, male sacta, and condonabam, but the expressions in the first
series are all weaker than those in the second.

9. opulentia, its resources. It is in the nominative case.

10. nunc vero: in antithesis to former occasions, when Cato
spoke on less vital questions—haec: i.e. imperium nostrum; see
on LI. ‹iz—cuiuscumque modi videntur: see on ἓ 5 of this
chapter.

11. Hic . . . nominat: this is an indignant question, giving
