80 BELLUM CATILINAE.

12. toreumata, vases worked in relies: a Greek word for the
Latin vasa caelata. As we sometimes use the French words
for delicacies imported from France, so the Romans used the
Greek terme-postremo, lastly, in show· it is often used like
prorsus to introduce the last of a series—trahunt, waste; for the
more usual compound distrahunt—summa lubidine, in spite qs*
the yreatest dissipaeion.—divitias suas vincere, to yet the better qs
their wealeh. Remark that traho, vexo, vinco are a-ll metaphors taken
