etc. It is not unlikely that to the same striving after word
effects, which led him into these mannetisms, we should ascribe
his fondness for archaisms. However, we must not indorse
this charge of his ancient critics indiscriminately. A careful
examination of Sallust’s vocabulary and grammatical usage has
convinced modern scholars that he uses not only many so-called
archaisms, but also many words and constructione that are
colloquial rather than archaic. Indeed, it is not always safe
to infer that a word which occurs, let ns say, in Plautus, and is
missed in Caesar and Cicero, was obsolete. Who will assure us
that it was not in common colloquial use, though the school of
Cicero may have condemned it? Nay, when we see a word
of this kind reappear immediately after Cicero, and continue
to be used by many later writers, must we not conclude that
this is the true explanation? If we apply this principle to
Sallust, the number of his archaisms becomes comparatively
small, and most of them occur in the speeches. Perhaps
Sallust used them there to give the speeches an archaic coloring
or to portray the speaker's peculiarities of language. As the
archaisms have been carefully pointed out in the notes, the
attentive student may form his own judgment on this question.
He will also observe in our author many other peculiarities‚ ’
such as the use of iyitur, ceterum, ad hoc, at the beginning of
sentences; his preference for the form ‚in -ere rather than -erunt
in the 3d pl. of the perfect indicative3 his use of quippe qui with
the indicative3 his fondness for the verb bahem his frequent use
of the historical infinitive. Perhaps some of these also were col-
loquialisms. At all events, the student will find in the notes
every assistance needed to study Sallust from the point of view

of style.
