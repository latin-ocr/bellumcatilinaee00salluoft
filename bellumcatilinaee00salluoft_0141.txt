by the preceding domi militiaeque. —quae res . . . sustinuisset,
what was the principalfoundation qs.

3. legionibus: is improperly and rarely used to designate non-
Roman troops; when so used it has the force of erercztus. —con-
tendisse: has for subject populum Romanum. — copiis: i.e. οριὸαε,
as appears ftom the antithesis opulentis reqibus. —fortunae violen-
tiam: here, as in VIII. 1, fortuna is persouified as domina, who
naturally has her violent capuces—facundia: neither facundia
nor facundus are found in Cicero or Caesar; the word means skill
in the use of words, whether by orators or diplomats.

4. mihi constabat, I became firmly convinced ,· mark the force
of the imperfect. —paucorumz not taken in a party sense as in
XXXIX. 1.-patravisse: see on XVIII. 8.—tactum: sc. esse.

5. rursm, in turn. — sustentabat: corresponds to sustinuisset in
§2.—sicuti effeta parente, as if tlte commonwealth (the mother
of her citizens) had become exhausted. —multis tempestatibus,
in a lony time. In this sense the plural of tempestas is rare—ma-
gnus: this is taken by some to be a stab at Pompey, to whom the
sumame of Maqnus was given by Sulla.

6. ingenti: see on XLVI. 1.-obtu1erat . . . fuit: these past
tenses are past from the reader's standpoint, like epistolary per-
fects. —naturam et mores, the natural and acquz'red qualities ,· i.e.
their character.

LIV. 1. Igitur: often begins a narrative, description, ete„ that
has just been promised. -- genus: though the Julian family was of
patrician, the qens Porcia of plebeian origin, both had belonged to
the nobility for a long time, and at this period were equally distin-
guished—aetas: Caesar was born in 100 13.c. (some say 102),
Cato in 95 13.c.— eloquentia, oratory; as an art. Cicero speaks
highly of Caesar as an orator. — alia, different in kind ,· hence altera
would be wrong here, though there is question of only two.

2. beneficius ac munificentia . . . integritate: though these
qualities are not in themselves opposed to each other, their rhetor-
ical antithesis suggests what was lacking in the two men compared.

3. Caesar dando: see on XLIX. 3.-1gnoscundo: compare
Cicero's words to Caesar in his speech for Ligarius, ξ 35: qui obli-
visci nihil soles nisi iniurias. —in altero . . . pernicies: the one
