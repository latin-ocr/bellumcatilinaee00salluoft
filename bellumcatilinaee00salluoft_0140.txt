114 BELLUM CATILINAE.

iussit: he did so by virtue of his rights as a famen—vos . .
cunctamini: asyndeton 3 in translating it is best to insert and ij
Manlius so punished his son, etc.

31. videlicet, like scilicet, usually introduces ironical statements.
—cetera : the nominative singular of this word is seldom found 3
the nominative singular masculine never, because the Latin avoids
the termination us after r. — cetera . . . obstat: their former
life stands opposed to this crime3 i.e. their former life secures them
against the suspicion ofhaviny committed this crime.

32. parcite . . . Lentuli, have some consideration for the official
position ⁰f Lentulus.

33. ignoscite Cethegi adulescentiae, pardon the youthful Cethe-
9us. ——iterum: perhaps he had taken part in Catiline's first con-
spiracy.

34. Quid . . . loquar : a pretended omission (paraleipsis or praete-
rz'tio). It implies that the worthlessness of Gabinius and his accom-
plices was too notorious to need proci—quibus . . . fuisset . . .
habuissent: this must not be taken as a proof of the foregoing
sentence, which needs no proof. It means: their contempt for every-
thing good has of necessity brought them into their present plight.

35. ipsa re, by tlte course of events. —1aucibus: ablativo 3 faucibus
uryere is stronger than saucibus tenere 01· premam-atque in sinu
urbis, and, what is more, in the beart of the city.—neque parari
neque consuli: translate these infinitives by using abstract nouns
and change occulte into an adjective. The construction consuli quic-
quam presupposes the construction consulere aliquid.

36. manutestis rerum: it follows from this that only a person
caught in the act was manufestus facinoris (cf. Liv. I. 7, 9). The
genitive is the same as that used with verbs of accusing and con-
demning.

LIII. 1. senatus magna pars: this did not include Caesar,
who still sought to defeat the measure 3 he failed, but with Cicero's
consent prevented the confiscation of the property of the con-
demned. —alii . . . increpantes: the histor-iaus often‘use the
reciprocal alius alium and alii alios with participles: ef. LII. 28.—
senati : cf. senatus magma pars and also XXX. 3.

2. mari atque terra: for variety’s sake, instead of the custom-
ary terra marique: the change oi arrangement is also influenced
