Norns. 87

. 3. senati: an old form of the genitive found often in inscriptions.
Sallust uses it only in combination with decretum and verba. --
Q. Marcius Rex: consul in 68 13.c.‚ and afterwards proconsul in
Cilicia, had there commanded against the pirates, before Pompey
took charge of the war against them. -Q. Metellus Creticus:
consul in 69 13.c.; after his term ot' office he carried on and fin-
ished the war against the Cretans. Pompey held that both Marcius
and Metellus were his subordinates, and as such not entitled to
a triumph.

4. utrique: plural, though only two are meant; see on V. 7. —
ad urbem, near tlte city. Generals (imperatores) clainiing a triumph
forseited their rights to this distinction by entering the city, for by
doing so they lost their command (imperium). Hence the Senate
generally met outside the city limits, in the temple of Apollo or that
of Bellona, near the Porta Carmentalis, to decide on their claims. —-

—pro tempore atque pen‘cu10‚ in accordance with the needs qs tlte

6. praemium: supply decrevere from the next clause—sester-
tia centum: the neuter sestertium = 1000 sestertii :3425ss generally
takes the distributive numeral with it; here it has the cardinal,
contrary to rule.

7. gladiatoriae familiae: bands of gladiatore, who were under
the instruction of a lanista, to prepare themselves for the gladia-
torial shows. They were desperate men who, having nothing to
lose, were ready for any undertaking. Here the gladiators in Rome
are meant—minores magistratus: aediles, quaestore, and tres-

often has this meaning. - quae: neuter, and refers to laetitia atque
