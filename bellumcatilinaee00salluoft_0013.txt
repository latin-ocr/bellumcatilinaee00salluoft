the quaestorship as the reward of his services, and again became
a senator. During the civil war he fought on Caesar’s side,> and
Caesar seems toqhave had confidence in his ability and loyalty.
When the legions in Campania revolted and slew the senators
sent to them by the dictator, he intrusted Sallust with the
delicate mission of bringing them back to their allegiance.
Sallust was unsuccessful and barely escaped with his life. In
fact, it took all of Caesar’s magnetism and moral sway to master
the revolt. When Caesar crossed into Africa to put down the
Pompeian forces there, Sallust at the head of a fieet seized the
island of Cercina, and its well-stored granaries, and relieved
Caesar of anxiety on the subject of his supplies. In short, he ‘
rendered such service to his chief during this campaign, that
after the battle of Thapsus (46 nc.) he was rewarded with the
governorship of the enlarged province of. Africa. The praetor-
ship had been conferi-ed on him some time before. In his
province Sallust seems to have been the typical Roman gov-
ernor whom he denounces so eloquently in his writings. When
he returned he was assailed by numerous charges of bribery
aud extortion. He was tried by Caesar, who acquitted him:
after his acquittal Sallust retired from political life, though
some passages in his writings lead us to suspect that the
measure of his ambition was far from full. Sallust’s acquittal
by Caesar no more establishes his innocence than his condemna·
tion by Appius Claudius Pulcher, in 50 13.c.‚ proves his guilt of
the crimes laid to his charge. So much is certain, that when
Sallust retired into private life, he was a very rich man. His
palace, at the scot of the Quirinal Hill, which was discovered
in 1885, astounds us to-day by its size aud the remains of its
splendor. Only the master of great wealth could have reared
it. Shortly after Sallust’s retirement, Caesar met his doom3 and
if Sallust had still any ambitious hopes, this event must have
put an end to them.

In his leisure, Sallust’s active mind turned to literature.
Modern critics are agreed that it was only now that he began
to write the works which have immortalized his name. His
