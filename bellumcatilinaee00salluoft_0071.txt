BELLUM cATmmAE. 45

Imm? Minume. Sed ita censes„ pnblioandas effu-um
fflcfinias, ips6s in vinculis habendos per municipia, quae
maxum& opibus valent: neu quis de eis postea ad sena-
tum referat, neve cum populo agat: qui aliter fecerit,
senatum existumare eum eontra rem publicam et 33111-

C'ato's speech: The question before us is not a question ⁰f punish-
ment, but of necessity, which knows no law (2-7).

Ι have war-ned you in the past, but times were not then critical.
Now the question is, Witl you preserve your own, or shall tlte
public enemy seize it? (7-11). Mercy is out of place when,
to save a few scoundrels, you will destroy all qood citizens
(ll-13).

Caesar has made an eloquent speech. He proposes to imprison the
conspirators in the towns of Italy. But they will be more danqer-
ous there than in Rome. If Caesar sears these men, lais plan is
useless; if he cloes not, so much the worse for us. In decidiny
the fate of the defendants, you decide tlte fate of Catiline and
his army (13-18).

Not by war, but by their virtues, have our forefatllers achieved
Rome’s yreatness. We {tave lost their virtues because of our
selfishness (18-24).

These men have plotted to destroy their native country, and made a
leoque with Rome's bitterest enemies; do you hesitate? do you
speak· of pity? (24-27). Beware lest your mercy ruin you (27).
Affairs are critical, but you are undismayed. Nuy, you are
comards, and trust to the qods. But the qods help not the pol-
troon, but the mise, tlte watchsul,‹1nd tlte brave (28-30). BIanlius
put to death his son for excessive bravery; you hesitate to punish
&aitars (30-32). Do the past lives of tlte defendants spealc for
them? They are hardened fools and criminals (32-35).. Lastly,
you have no choica· you must either cruslz Catiline or per—ish
younelves (35). Therefore, I move that they be put to death,
according to tlte laws of our fore-fathers (36).
