76 BELLUM cAmLINAE.

various colonies and municipal towns of Italy. —doml‚ in their
own town.

5. complures nobiles: is the subject of erant.

6. pleraque: in Cicero only the plural of this word is found„
Sallust has the singular forms pleraque, plerumque, with collective
nouns3 cf. XXIII. 6, XXXVIII. 2. The form plerusque, like
aeterua, is not used because the Latin language rejects -us after
r. —copia erat = licebat ‚· hence the infinitive.

7. M. Licinius Crassus: the triumvir, famous for his great
wealth. He defeated Spartacus in 71 13.c., though Pompey reaped
the chief glory; hence their enmity. He joined Pompey and
Caesar in the first triumvirate (60 13.c.), and fell at Carrhae in
Mesopotamia, defeated by the Parthians (53 noy—invisus ipsi :
translate by a relative clause. —cuiusvim any one *except Pom-

Ι pey3 hence his sympathy with Catiline.—apud illos: i.e. coniura-

δψι-ἰρῐιε to the conspiracy are discussed more at length in XLVIII.

XV 111. 1. de qua: the relative refers to coniuratio, suggested by
the verb coniuravere in the preceding sentence3 this synesis is
unparalleled and extremely harsh.

2. 1.. 'l'ullo et Μ’. Lepido coss. ε 66 1³.c. —ambitus interro-
gati: Cicero and Caesar do not construe interr-090 as a verb of
acousing (verbum iudiciale).—P. Sulla: another relative of the
great Sulla, an avaricious but insignificant man. He was defended
in 62 nc. by Cicero ; Sulla on that occasion was tried for being privy
to both of Catiline's plots, but acquitted.— poenas dederant: the
Lex Calpurnia of 67 B-C. punished bribery with exclusion from
office and pecuniary fines.

3. Post paulo: paulo post is the regular orden—pecuniarum

. . reus, charyed with extortion. He was repetundarum reus, from
whom the provincials demanded the property belonging to them
of right, for repeto means I demand what belonys to me. Sallust,
however, is* wrong here. Catiline was not indicted till 65 nc. nor
tried till after the election of the consuls for the year 64 B.c. The
reason why he did not stand for the consulship was the refusal of
the consul Tullus, on the advice of men of distinction, to recognize
Catiline as a candidate. The reason of this refusal was that the
people of Africa, os which province Catiline had been governor
in 67 1³.c., had lodged complaints of extortion against him in the
