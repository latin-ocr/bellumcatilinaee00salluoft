de L. (lassis), P. Furio, P. Umbreno, Q. Annio, si depre- ¹
hensi forent, supplicium sslmundum decreveram isque ε
postea, permotus eratione C. Caesaris, pedibus in sen· ²

'centiam Ti. Neronis itflrum se dixerat, qui de ea re

5 praesidiis additis referundum censuerat. Sed Caesar,
ubi ad eum ventum est, rogatus sententiam ἐι 06nsule
hfiiusee modi verba locatus est:

Caesar‘s speech: Judyes should be free from prejudice (1-4).
Rome has always reyarded her own diynity rather than the
yuilt of those who wronyed her <4-7). Follow this tradition
now (7-9). Be not carried away by inflammatory haranyues
(9—12). A yrcat responsibility rests upon you (12). Do not
expose yourself to the charye of cruelty, thouyh the aocused
deserve the sternest punishment -(13-16).

Silanus's motion is unwise (16-18). It is inspired either by sear
or by a sense of wrony. Fear is out of the question, for Cicero
has provided ample means os defense (18-20). As a punish-
ment the death penalty is objectionable, lst‚ because it is no
punishment (25); 2d, because it is illeyal (21-25); 3d, because
you will set α bad precedent for the future, as proved by the
example of the Thirty Tyrants at Athens and by Sulla’s pro—
scription at home (25-35). Cicero will not abuse his power,
but who will yuarantee the future (35-37)‘?

our ancestors were wise and practical men ; they allowed exile as
an alternative to the condemned. That is my stronyest aryument
ayainst novel proceedinqs now (37-43).

My motion is to confiscate the property of the accused, to imprison
them in the Italian towns, and to forbid any reopeniny of their case

(43).
